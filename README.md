# acme_exercise
The goal of this exercise is to output a table containing pairs of employees and how often they have coincided in the office.

The application has an interface developed in HTML which allows to visualize the input data and the result of the match search between pairs of employees at the same time.

The input data can be uploaded to a button, which allows to attach an input file with the data. The allowed file type is '.txt'.

The logic development was implemented in Javascript, two Javascript execution files were implemented. The 'index.js' file has the main functional logic for finding the match between employees, and the 'modules'js' file contains all the secondary functions implemented.
